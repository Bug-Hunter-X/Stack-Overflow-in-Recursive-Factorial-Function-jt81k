# Stack Overflow in Recursive Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow. The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number recursively.  For large inputs, the recursive calls can exceed the stack limit, resulting in a runtime error.

The solution demonstrates how to avoid this by using an iterative approach.
